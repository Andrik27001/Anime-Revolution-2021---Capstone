The main goal of this project is to test the HTML and CSS skills that one has. Secondarily it also tests the knowledge of other technologies such as bootstrap and media queries by building a website following a pre-designed design of a "client". In this project, it is supposed to follow the design chosen by the client (fonts, colors, structure, etc.) to simulate the real work of a web developer. It is not only a good project to test practical skills but also to get our creativity going by choosing the theme of the page and building everything from there. In this case, I chose to simulate an Anime Convention theme, go ahead and take a look. 

I hope you enjoy it!
